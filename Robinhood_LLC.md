# Robinhood works harder, allowing you to work smarter!

## Overview and Origin

* Robinhood Financial LLC

* Robinhood Financial LLC was founded in 2013 in Menlo Park, California. Former classmates at Stanford, Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, realized while working in New York how little financial institutions pay to trade stocks while passing on a commission to most consumers. After building trading software and selling it to big firms they decided to head back to the West Coast and focus on building a trading platform that provides access to the market at little to no cost to everyone. Whether individuals were young, inexperienced, just starting out or trading in smaller quantities, Vladimir and Baiju wanted to create an opportunity for anyone to invest in their future. According to crunchbase.com, in the eight years since Robinhoods inception, Robinhood has currently secured $2.2 billion dollars through eighteen rounds of funding including a makeup of around fifty investors. The latest round offered was a series G offering which sounds a little alarming initially but PrivCo recently has valued the Robinhood to be have a worth of over $10 billion dollars. Speculation also has it that Robinhood has a good chance of being a top IPO this year. 

## Business Activities:

* __What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?__
*Robinhood’s mission statement is to help financial tools and education become accessible to everyone. Not only that, but they are also trying to provide trading at no cost to non-institutional buyers. 

* __Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?__
* When Robinhood launched they had the idea to tap into a new market, the micro investor. This mostly consisted of the younger adult population and the groups of people who either: couldn’t afford the required minimums at competing firms to open an account, or the group who was trading but with a lower amount and wanted to bypass all the fees eating away at their profits as they build their portfolio. In terms of market size, Robinhood knew it had attracted a market with over 700,000 users signing up and being put on the wait list a month before they launched. As of May 2020, Robinhood has 20 million users. 

* __What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)__
* Initially Robinhood had a huge leg up on competition on offering commission-free ETFs as well as offering fractional shares. Companies were traditionally offering trades anywhere between $5-$10 dollars. It may seem like a nominal amount but when you are trading with a smaller portfolio this will absolutely just eat away at any profitable trades that are made in smaller amounts. The idea of buying fractional shares was also big. Apple has been one of the most popular stocks within the past 15 years and before they’ve had several splits, one share could have cost you hundreds of dollars. The idea was for investors to still capitalize on gains with stocks that were priced significantly higher without having to commit a large portion of their portfolio to purchase and still being able to diversify. As competitors throughout the years have lowered fees or eliminated them entirely for certain trades in order to compete with a company like Robinhood, Robinhood itself continues to position itself towards millennials or other micro investors. Using technology, have created a real user-friendly app that is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. The home screen displays the amount in the entire portfolio and is defaulted with the gain/loss for your portfolio for that trading day. With a click of one button, you can see how your portfolio is performing in the past week, month, year, all time et cetera. Underneath the portfolio it brings the customized watchlist to show the companies the user has selected to see how those companies are performing. It’s “Browse” section is aimed at making it really easy for investors to see any global news effecting the market. It also has popular lists portion for users to see if they are interested in new markets or anything that’s been trending. For example, you can click the 100 Most Popular tab to see what has the highest market volume or anything with significant gains or losses. If you are looking to diversify your portfolio and want to enter a new industry like cannabis, you can access that and see what companies are actively trading in that sector, giving the user a foundation of companies to research and to understand why those companies are trading the way they are. 

* __Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)__
* According to stackshare.com, Robinhood utilizes: Python, React, NGINX, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Ubuntu, Redis, Amazon EC2, Sass, Django, Redux, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Go, Swift, Kotlin, Memcached, Celery, Airflow, RxJava, Faust, Google Analytics, Elasticsearch, Retrofit, GitHub, Git, among others. 
* They seem to heavily rely on AWS with such a small team. Having just a handful of people on the team, Robinhood used AWS to help create the entire system. AWS has also benefited Robinhood from a security standpoint in identifying money laundering or fraud. AWS also helps them manage the high traffic they see at market open or big events. One of the biggest strengths of AWS is probably being able to see real time analytics throughout the day and manage the info in the best way possible being a smaller company in terms of employees.

## Landscape:

* __What domain of the financial industry is the company in?__
* Robinhood helps individuals learn, create and understand Wealth and Investment Management. 

* __What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?__
* The biggest trend in these domains has to be accessibility, affordability and education. Robinhood claims a user can create an account in less then 10 minutes, making it simple to start and using a smart phone to upload any documentation needed for approval. Companies have actively dropped commissions on certain trades to grab market share and offer incentives to sign up. They have made it incredibly easy to access target portfolios or recommending mutual funds based on the individuals risk appetite using algorithms after asking the user to answer several questions. 

* __What are the other major companies in this domain?__
* Competitors include E-Trade, Charles Schwab, Freetrade, eToro, TDAmeritrade, Webull, Binance, and Fidelity.

## Results

* __What has been the business impact of this company so far?__
*It is the fastest growing investment company in the world with over 20 million users. Also simplifies how we look at investing. Understanding a user can start with a smaller amount and if disciplined and equipped with the proper tools can also participate in the world of finance. The biggest impact is reminding individuals that they do have control over their financial future, whether starting with a $100 deposit or $10,000. Taking the notion that “Investing?! I live paycheck to paycheck” to building the idea it can be seen as a glorified savings account where you have your money working for you or taking smaller steps to build wealth can be achievable and build that mindset/discipline. 

* __What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?__ 
*Some look at the revenue brought in from Payment for Order Flow (PFOF). Sometimes a gray area in finance because this method may not always be in the best interest of the investor, pays companies for directing orders do different parties for execution. Investment firms call it a “rebate” for sending the orders to the other party. Robinhood pulled in $180 million in income from PFOF in the 2nd quarter of 2020 compared to $66 million from Schwab, $110 million from E*Trade and $324 million from TDAmeritrade in the same quarter. Also, Robinhood boasting itself as the fastest growing platform in the field and offering services like a Robinhood Gold membership have made other firms take note.  

* __How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?__
* Robinhood has established itself as a main player in the digital platform investing world. It has since opened its trading to certain cryptocurrencies and complex options. I believe it will continue to be a leading contender with the younger generation as well as continuing its education platform to give individuals more tools to make profitable decisions and execute more trades increasing their income through PFOF. 

## Recommendations

* __If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)__
* I think Robo Advising is an incredible tool and can help users manage their portfolio at ease. These users may trade less which would create less of an opportunity of income on these accounts but would open themselves up to help individuals who still seem overwhelmed in the market and be able to establish a relationship with Robinhood and create wealth. This way if they do create supplemental income the individual has already become familiarized with Robinhood’s tools and will likely continue to use them as their preferred trading platform if they do want dabble more in the market and execute trades. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* Establishing a relationship early with an individual is key to retaining them. Making an individual feel comfortable with where they put their money and adding this tool can help take the burden off of investors in creating their portfolio if they are completely foreign to investing. 

* __What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?__
* It would automate investment strategies using Modern Portfolio Theory along with algorithms and AI to rebalance your portfolio when necessary. Companies such as Empirica create software to utilize Robo Advising across financial markets.

* __Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?__
* They provide the tools to successfully execute the solutions investors are looking for and help build an entire portfolio based on their preferences. a
